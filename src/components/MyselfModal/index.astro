    <p class='myself-wrapper__modal__text'>
      I has been introduced in the IT world when I started to study in 2015. I came from a bachelor of humanities, so it was a very steep ride. 
    </p>
    <p class='myself-wrapper__modal__text'>
      My friends and colleagues helped me a lot with my studies so today I'm working as frontend software engineer thanks to them!
    </p>
    <p class='myself-wrapper__modal__text'>
      Besides my job, I like play videogames (especially the RTS and fighting games), drink coffee, watch series / anime / movies, workout on the gym, and spending time with my girlfriend.
