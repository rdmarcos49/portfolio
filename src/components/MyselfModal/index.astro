      I has been introduced in the IT world when I started to study in 2015. I come from a bachelor of humanities, so it was a very steep ride.

      My friends and career colleges help's me a lot with my studies so today I'm working as frontend software engineer thanks to them!

      Aside my job, I like play videogames (especially the RTS and fighting games), drink coffee, watch series / anime / movies, workout on the gym when I can, and spending time with my girlfriend.
