# Portfolio

I created this project to show my CV in a more fancy way. I used [Astro](https://astro.build/) and plain JavaScript for this project because I wanted a fast webpage and to avoid using some specific framework, such as React or Angular.

I deployed this app using Vercel. I used it in the past and it's pretty comfortable, easy to use and the deployments are very fast.

I designed the UI and a coworker UI/UX gave me a hand with good practices and tips about icons, spaces, content, etc (Rodri if you are reading this, yes, I'm talking about you).

I tried to keep the page simple, with one or two animations and a mobile version of it.

These are some screens of the first ideas for the UI (don't panic, the current app isn't so ugly):
